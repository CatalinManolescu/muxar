_Musical UX Smart Enhancer_


Develop a multi-device application which provides various musical user experiences based on existing music library available offline or on the Web via specific musical public open services like MusicBrainz and Seevl.fm. The application will display, in a smart way, the connections (relationships) between different songs/artists by genre, album, artist, album cover, geographical location, etc. It will also show a timeline exploration of artists, genres, influences and so on by using the knowledge offered by DBpedia or a specific linked data repository. The user will be able to create "smart" playlists, considered her/his preferences, playing history (eventually, provided by Last.fm or a smilar music-related service), past concert attendances based on the user's public calendar, near-future events organized in a specific place, and so on. These playlists will be shared and accessed via a SPARQL endpoint.
